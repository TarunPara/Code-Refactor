# Code Refactor Starter Code

Horiseon Digital Marketing Services

Description

I've updated the website to be clearer and easier to use. Now, it uses special web page parts like `header` and `article` instead of just `div` tags, which helps show what each section is for.

The way these parts are put together makes sense, not just by how they look, which helps make the website work better and easier to look after.

I also made sure every picture on the site has a simple explanation, so people who use tools to help them read the screen can understand what's shown.

The titles on the page, like `h1`, `h2`, and `h3`, are used in the right order to organize the information well.

The name of the webpage tells you quickly what the site is about, making sure it's straightforward and friendly for all users.
